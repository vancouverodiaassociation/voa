# _data/gdrive_gallery.yml
#
# Instructions for populating this file:
# 1. This file defines the albums and photos for your full gallery page.
# 2. You need to replace the placeholder data below with information from your Google Drive.
# 3. For each sub-directory in your shared Google Drive folder, create an "album" entry.
# 4. For each photo, you'll need:
#    - A direct URL to the full-size image (for lightbox).
#      Example for Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=YOUR_FILE_ID
#    - A URL to a thumbnail image (for the gallery grid).
#      Example for Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=YOUR_FILE_ID&sz=w400 (w400 suggests a 400px width, adjust as needed for "large thumbnails")
